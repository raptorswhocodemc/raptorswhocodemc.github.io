# Our Mission
Raptors Who Code is the club for anyone in a tech field--or anyone interested in one--to dive deeper into the world of programming and computers. 

We aim to help our members build their portfolios by making social connections, holding tech--related talks, attending hackathons, and providing a positive, friendly environment for you to learn.
